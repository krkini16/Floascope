# Floascope
Tool for tracking incoming tcp flows into a machine


For development purposes, we assume you're running Linux 3.x+

To run the server, ensure that you have pip (Python package index) installed and run :

'''pip install flask'''

To ensure scraping is properly done, run

'''apt-get install scapy'''

Among other tools, this should automatically install libpcap and other dependencies.
